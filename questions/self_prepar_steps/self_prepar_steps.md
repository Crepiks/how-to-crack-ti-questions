# Self-prepare Steps

## As soon as you know which project you will be interviewing for:
1. Ask your MR to provide position information: 
 - requirements;
 - technologies; 
2. Find the project in the [Telescope](https://telescope.epam.com/) and look through technologies:
 - find project in the Telescope;
 - find relevant to your position project member;
 - go to his/her profile -> past projects;
 - find needed project and look at `Participation`, `Database`, `Technologies`;

If you are not familiar with some of required technologies try to study these topics to be able to answer questions.


## Be ready to answer questions in English (especially if customer is foreign):
1. Be ready to describe your past project and your roles on these projects;
2. Prepare short story about yourself: hobbies, how ypu spend your leisure
